## Unreleased

* 🚀 Added `Player.videoWidth` and `Player.videoHeight`
* 🐛 Fixed player not following device rotation while fullscreen. 

## v1.3.0 (2023-06-29)

* 🚀 Added `THEOplayerTheme.playerAnimations` to control the animation settings of the various UI components.
* 🐛 Fix consuming apps unable to install different version of the THEOplayer Android SDK.

## v1.2.0 (2023-06-28)

* 💥 Renamed `PlayerState` to `Player`.
* 🚀 Added overloads to `DefaultUI` and `UIController` that accept a `Player`.
  This allows constructing a player instance in advance, and even moving it between custom UIs when recomposing.

## v1.1.0 (2023-06-27)

* 💥 Update to THEOplayer Android SDK 5.
  To migrate, switch to `com.theoplayer.theoplayer-sdk-android:core` in your Gradle dependencies.
  ```diff
    dependencies {
  -   implementation "com.theoplayer.theoplayer-sdk-android:unified:+"
  +   implementation "com.theoplayer.theoplayer-sdk-android:core:5.+"
      implementation "com.theoplayer.android-ui:android-ui:1.+"
    }
  ```
* 🚀 Added a `UIController` overload which accepts a `THEOplayerView` directly.

## v1.0.0 (2023-04-05)

* 🚀 Initial release.
